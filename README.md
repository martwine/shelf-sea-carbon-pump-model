shelf-sea-carbon-pump-model
===========================

Framework for modelling and evaluating shelf sea carbon pump processes

Initally this will be a simple 1-D box model looking at surface processes over the seasonal cycle (Spring-autumn).

Boundary conditions:

inorganic nitrate concentration
temperature

processes parameterised:

air-sea CO2 exchange
carbonate system equilibrium
organic matter dynamics and stoichiometry
overflow production / preferential remineralisation
ammonium-driven recycled production
Export out of mixed layer


state variables

CO2 system
POC/N
DOC/N
NH4
TEP
